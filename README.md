# expo-next-postgres

This is an example of a mobile application with posts, comments.

- A React Native iOS and Android application.
- Uses [Expo](https://expo.io).
- The entire application is written with JavaScript.
- The entire [web client & server](https://github.com/jimmylee/next-postgres) is also written in JavaScript.

üê® This code is for you to take! My only hope is that it is helpful.

## How do I try it?

Open it here with Expo Client on your phone: [https://expo.io/@jimmylee/expo-next-postgres](https://expo.io/@jimmylee/expo-next-postgres).

üõ†Ô∏è [Get Expo Client here](https://expo.io/tools).

## How do I run this locally?

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Globally install `exp` or use [Expo XDE](https://expo.io/tools).

```sh
npm install -g exp
exp login
exp start
```

## Why is this useful?

I love JavaScript and love being able to build native iOS, Android, web frontend & backend all in one language.

**Details**

- The experience is a native experience, not a web view.
- [next-postgres](https://github.com/jimmylee/next-postgres) and [expo-next-postgres](https://github.com/jimmylee/expo-next-postgres) can be merged into one codebase, and share +80% of the code.
- Your team doesn't have to learn separate ecosystems (Swift, Objective-C, or Java) to maintain the codebase(s).
- üõ´ Easy to pick up if you know [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
- üì≤ Use Expo tools to do hard things like [deploying to app store](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/building-standalone-apps.html).
